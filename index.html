            <h3>Hello,</h3>
            <h1>I'm Ranen</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am a Year 1 student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, pursuing a Diploma in Information Technology. I have always been interested in full stack development and software engineering. I have basic skills in programming languages (Such as Python, Javascript, HTML & CSS, SQL, C#), networking, databases, and operating systems, which I am excited to develop further through my studies.</p>

            <p>Ice skating is one of the activities I enjoy, for a few years now I have gone ice skating every term break or holiday with my friends (It's tradition now). Often, I liked to go to the ice rink @Jcube, although they shut it down in 2023 ðŸ˜¡.</p>

            <p>I have learnt piano since I was 7, and have enjoyed playing many different types of pieces from different genres. Despite stopping for a few years after finishing my grade 5 exam, I am currently continuing to practice it after picking it back up.</p>

            <p>Traveling is one of the rare activties which I enjoy the most. I like having the chance to explore new countries and see places in person where I have always wanted to visit. The most notable trips I have are my Malaysia and Japan trips which I enjoyed exhaustively ðŸ¤©.</p>

            <h1>CCA (Sec School)</h1>
            <p>
                <span>NPCC</span> was not one of the 3 choices of CCAs I had applied for in secondary school, but if given the chance, I would pick NPCC as my CCA without hesitation. Initially, I was unsure of what to expect, but soon I realized that NPCC offered more than just physical training and drills. It provided me with a sense of discipline, teamwork, and leadership that I hadn't anticipated. The bonds I formed over the years during activities such as unit camps, drills and especially leading the Sec 2 batch in 2023 as their squad IC, was truly rewarding. Looking back, Iâ€™m grateful for the unexpected journey that created many profound memories and shaped me into who I am today.
